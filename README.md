# Canvas: Project 2
An Interactive Full-Stack Application


Canvas is an artist centered database/website/social media site, where users can upload and display their work. 

As an alternative to DeviantArt, Canvas allows artists to showcase their visual art in a space that someday hopes to be a social media site specially serving visual artists and still-life photographers. As a more positive alternative than Instagram and more social mediaesque variation to deviant art classic website, Canvas combines what artist used to love about Instagram while using the model of deviant art as inspiration. Using mysql, handlebars, etc., the creators of Canvas designed a user friendly website that gives artist the space and database needed to display their work.

To use Canvas, please sign up at canvas.org and create an account. Once signed up, follow the directions supplied on the website or click on the upload photos button to add photos to your profile. Once signed up, user can upload or delete their work on Canvas and view other artists on Canvas.

In this MVP model, all requirements of project two have been met including:


In future updates, we see this project expanding to allowing user to comment on other people photos, paintings, drawings, etc. However, in order to turn this from an interesting website to marketable/viable application later versions of this website would include expanding Canvas by creating a dedicated phone app that would allow more people to use Canvas.
